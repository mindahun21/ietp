# Smart Hospital Bed Mobile App

## Overview
This Flutter-based mobile application is part of the "Smart Hospital Bed for Patients" project, developed during an Integrated Engineering Team Project at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (Dec 2024). The app enables caregivers to remotely monitor and control a smart hospital bed, enhancing patient care and mobility while aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).

## Features
- **Real-Time Health Monitoring**: Displays patient vital signs (e.g., temperature, pressure) collected via bed-integrated sensors.
- **Remote Bed Adjustments**: Allows caregivers to adjust bed positions (lying, sitting, chair mode) with a user-friendly interface.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends timely alerts for critical health changes or system issues, ensuring prompt intervention.
- **Intuitive UI**: Designed for ease of use, catering to caregivers regardless of technical expertise.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter & Dart**: Cross-platform framework for building the mobile app.
- **Arduino**: smart bedâ€™s Arduino UNO microcontroller for sensor data and motor control.
- **Wireless Sensor Networks**: Facilitates real-time data transfer from bed sensors.
- **Git**: Version control for collaborative development.
