# Smart Hospital Bed for Patients

## Overview
The "Smart Hospital Bed for Patients" is an innovative healthcare solution developed by a multidisciplinary team of 10 students at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University during the Integrated Engineering Team Project (IETP4115, Dec 2024). This project aims to enhance patient mobility, comfort, and safety while reducing caregiver workload, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being). It integrates advanced hardware, sensors, and a Flutter-based mobile app for real-time monitoring and control.

## Features
- **Adjustable Positioning**: Transitions between lying, sitting, and chair modes using stepper and servo motors for patient comfort and mobility.
- **Real-Time Health Monitoring**: Tracks vital signs (temperature, pressure, vibration) via integrated sensors, updating electronic records instantly.
- **Remote Control**: A mobile app allows caregivers to adjust bed settings and receive alerts for critical health changes.
- **Pressure Ulcer Prevention**: Side-to-side tilting and pressure sensors minimize risks of bedsores.
- **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive interfaces and ergonomic bed structure prioritize ease of use for patients and caregivers.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO, Stepper Motors, Servo Motors, Pressure Sensors, Temperature Sensors, Vibration Sensors, 24V Rechargeable Battery, DC-DC Buck Converter.
- **Software**: Flutter (Mobile App), Dart, Arduino IDE, Wireless Sensor Networks.
- **Tools**: CAD (for bed frame design), Git (version control), Nextion HMI Display (optional UI).

## Project Components
1. **Smart Bed Hardware**  
   - Aluminum/metal bed frame with wheels for mobility.
   - Motorized adjustments for vertical and lateral movements.
   - Sensors for health and posture monitoring.

2. **Mobile Application**  
   - Built with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
   - See [Mobile App README](Frontend/ietp_new/README.md) for details.

3. **Control System**  
   - Arduino UNO processes sensor data and controls motor adjustments.
   - Cloud storage logs patient health data for analysis.
